# UnrealEnginePlugin
 *This is not a published plugin*

 I developed a C++ plugin for Unreal Engine that enhances the placement and orientation of actors within a scene. This plugin identifies all actors with a specified tag, then rotates them to face the player and moves them to optimal locations on the navmesh. This ensures that all NPCs are correctly positioned and oriented in the game world, contributing to a more immersive and dynamic gameplay experience.
